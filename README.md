Your project is a simple chat application built using PHP, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to engage in a real-time conversation by submitting messages and displaying them in a chat room format. Here's a summary of the key features and structure:

Key Features:
User Authentication (Username):

A user can set their username once at the beginning. If not already set, the system prompts for a username input.
Message Handling:

Once the username is set, users can send messages which are stored in the session. Messages are displayed in the order they were received.
Only the last 10 messages are shown in the chat, keeping the interface clean and concise.
Message Display:

Each message is displayed with the sender's username.
Messages are styled to differentiate between the current user’s messages (aligned to the right) and others’ messages (aligned to the left).
Session Management:

PHP sessions are used to store messages and user data.
On logout, the session is destroyed, and the user is redirected to the starting page, prompting them for a username again.
CSS Styling:

The chat interface is clean, responsive, and styled to offer an intuitive experience.
Messages are styled differently for the current user and other users to visually distinguish between them.
The layout is centered with flexbox for responsiveness.
Logout Functionality:

A Logout button allows the user to log out and clear their session. After logging out, they are redirected to the starting page.
Technical Details:
Frontend: HTML and CSS for the structure and style of the chat interface.
Backend: PHP is used to manage session data, handle form submissions, and render the chat interface dynamically.
Session Storage: Messages and username data are stored in PHP sessions, ensuring that the chat persists across requests but can be reset when the user logs out.
Workflow:
User visits the page and is asked to set their username if it's not already set.
User sends a message after entering their username, and the message is displayed in the chat window.
Messages are limited to the last 10 displayed, maintaining a clean UI.
Logout clears the session, and the user is redirected to the username input page.
This project provides a basic, functional chat application with simple session handling. Let me know if you'd like to expand any part of the functionality!
